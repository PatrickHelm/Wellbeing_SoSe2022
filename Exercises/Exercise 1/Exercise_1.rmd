## Preparation

Please work through the [Prerequisites section](https://github.com/tud-ise/Wellbeing_SoSe2022/blob/main/README.md#0-prerequisites) to be prepared for the first exercise.

## What is R?

R is a free software environment for statistical analysis.

### Graphical User Interface

Your opened RStudio should look something like the following:

<img src="./MD_IMG/RStudio_GUI.png" width="960" height="525/"/>

The RStudio GUI consists of several areas. In the console area, R code can be entered, which is then interpreted (executed) by R. The `>` character is the R prompt (prompt character). This means that you can work with R interactively, using it as a calculator, for example:

```{r}
2+3
exp(1)
3/4
```

In the upper right corner, besides the History, which lists all the commands you have executed so far, we find the Environment section. There you will find all the variables, data sets and functions that have been defined.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

| Command   | Meaning                                   | Example (if appropriate) |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| \+        | Addition                                  |                          |
| \-        | Subtraction                               |                          |
| \*        | Multiplication                            |                          |
| /         | Division                                  |                          |
| ^ or \*\* | Exponentiation                            |                          |
| x %\*% y  | Matrix Multiplication                     | c(1,4) %\*% c(3,5) == 23 |
| %/%       | Whole Number Division                     | 6 %/% 4 == 1             |
| %%        | Modulo (Remainder of a Division; x mod y) | 6 %% 4 == 2              |

### Logic Operators

| Command   | Meaning            | Example (if appropriate)   |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| ==        | Equal              |                            |
| !=        | Unequal            |                            |
| \<        | Smaller than       |                            |
| \>        | Greater than       |                            |
| \<=       | Smaller equal      |                            |
| \>=       | Greater equal      |                            |
| &         | Logical AND        | (x & y)                    |
| \|        | Logical OR         | (x \| y)                   |
| !         | Logical NOT        | !x                         |
| xor(x, y) | Exclusive OR       | Either in x or y, not both |
| isTRUE(x) | Tests if x is true |                            |

The following graphic shows the use of the logical operators by means of Venn diagrams. `x` always refers to the left circle, `y` to the right. The selected area is always shown in dark. Source: [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

## R Functions

In the following we will look at some of the standard R functions that can be used and that make up the language in the first place. Each function can be called in the documentation (even if it was inserted via a library - more to that later). Just call the command `help(fct-name)` (just type it into the console). There you get a first overview about the function and its parameters.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
help(seq)
```

### Numerical Functions

| Command              | Meaning              | Example (if appropriate)         |
|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| abs(x)               | Absolute Value       |                                  |
| sqrt(x)              | Square root          |                                  |
| ceiling(x)           | Round Up             | ceiling(4.687) is 5              |
| floor(x)             | Round Off            | floor(4.687) is 4                |
| round(x, digits = n) | Rounding             | round(4.687, digits = 2) is 4.69 |
| log(x)               | Natural Logarithm    |                                  |
| log2(x)              | Logarithm to base 2  |                                  |
| log10(x)             | Logarithm to base 10 |                                  |
| exp(x)               | Exponential Function | e^x                              |

### Statistical Functions

These functions all have the argument `na.rm`, which by default takes the value `FALSE`. This allows missing values to be taken into account, i.e. missing values (na = not available) are not removed in this case (rm = remove). These functions can all be applied to a vector (see below).

| Command                | Meaning                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| mean(x, na.rm = FALSE) | Mean Value                                        |
| sd(x)                  | Standard Deviation                                |
| var(x)                 | Variance                                          |
| median(x)              | Median                                            |
| quantile(x, probs)     | Quantiles of X (probs: Vector with Probabilities) |
| sum(x)                 | Sum                                               |
| min(x)                 | Minimum Value (x_min)                             |
| max(x)                 | Maximum Value (x_max)                             |
| range(x)               | x_min and x_max                                   |

### Further Useful Functions

**Generation of a Vector**

`c(2,5,7,2,6)`

Vectors can be called as you like: `vector = c(2,5,7,2,6)`

Generation of a Sequence: `seq(from, to, by)`

```{r}
seq(1, 5, 0.5)
```

**Colon Operator**

`:` generates a regular sequence (i.e., sequence in steps of one)

```{r}
1:6
```

**Repetition of X**

`rep(x, times, each)`

-   times = the sequence is repeated n times

-   each = each element is repeated n times

```{r}
rep(1:6, times=2)
```

```{r}
rep(1:6, each=2)
```

**Display of the n first elements of x**

`head(x, n = 6)`

```{r include=FALSE}
x = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144)
```

```{r}
head(x, n = 6)
```

**Display of the n last elements of x**

`tail(x, n = 6)`

```{r}
tail(x, n = 6)
```

#### Examples

``` R
c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

mean(c(1, NA, 3, 4, 5, 6), na.rm = TRUE)

mean(c(1, NA, 3, 4, 5, 6), na.rm = FALSE)

sd(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

sum(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

min(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

range(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6))

seq(from = 1, to = 6, by = 1)

1:6

rep(1:6, times = 2)

rep(1:6, each = 2)

rep(1:6, times = 2, each = 2)
```
