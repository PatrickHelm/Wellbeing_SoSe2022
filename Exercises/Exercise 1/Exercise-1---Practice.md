## Preparation

1. Install the `tidyverse` package by running `install.packages("tidyverse")`
   Tidyverse is a group of very popular packages (e.g., `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2` or `stringr`). This installation needs to run only once.
1. Load `tidyverse` by typing `library(tidyverse)` and hitting `Enter ‚èé`. You need to run this every time you open RStudio again.
