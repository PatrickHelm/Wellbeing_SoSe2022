## Preparation

1. Install the `tidyverse` package by running `install.packages("tidyverse")`
   Tidyverse is a group of very popular packages (e.g., `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2` or `stringr`). This installation needs to run only once.
1. Load `tidyverse` by typing `library(tidyverse)` and hitting `Enter ‚èé`. You need to run this every time you open RStudio again.
1. Even if you work with R every day, it is (almost) impossible to remember all the functions. R has a very good built-in help system, but it is not very easy to understand for beginners. This is accessible in the Help section. If you want to search specifically, you can enter a term in the Help Viewer search window. If you simply want to find out what features are available in an installed package, you can search for a package in the Packages area and then click on it to see the help pages.
1. If you want to get quick help on a function in the console, you can proceed like this: `help(mean)` - This opens the help page for the mean function. Alternatively, you can also enter `?mean`. 
1. One can also search for help on a topic. For example, if you need help on rounding numbers up or down, you can type `help("round")`. More help on the `help()` function can be found like this: `help(help)`.
