# Exercise Number 1: Introduction to R - Exercises

## Christopher Diebel & Jan-Hendrik Schmidt - ISE Darmstadt

## Preparation

1. Even if you work with R every day, it is (almost) impossible to remember all the functions. R has a very good built-in help system, but it is not very easy to understand for beginners. This is accessible in the Help section. If you want to search specifically, you can enter a term in the Help Viewer search window. If you simply want to find out what features are available in an installed package, you can search for a package in the Packages area and then click on it to see the help pages.
1. If you want to get quick help on a function in the console, you can proceed like this: `help(mean)` - This opens the help page for the mean function. Alternatively, you can also enter `?mean`. 
1. One can also search for help on a topic. For example, if you need help on rounding numbers up or down, you can type `help("round")`. More help on the `help()` function can be found like this: `help(help)`.


## Practice Exercises

### Operators and Numerical Functions
Calculate using RStudio:

2. How can you calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;e}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} e}" /> 
3. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;\sqrt{2}}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} \sqrt{2}}" /> 
4. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;\sqrt[3]{8}}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} \sqrt[3]{8}}" /> 
5. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;log_2(8)}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} log_2(8)}" /> 

### Statistical Functions

1. Create a sequence from 0 to 100 in steps of 5 by executing 
2. Calculate the mean value of the vector [1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 2].
3. Display the span <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;x_{max}&space;-&space;x_{min}}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} x_{max} - x_{min}}" /> of this vector.
4. Calculate the sum of this vector.

### Data Frames
One advantage of packages like `tidyverse` is that sample data is often included, making it particularly clear why the packages are useful. We use the tibble `starwars` from the `tidyverse` package.

#### Group Task

0. Get to know the dataset

```R
starwars
View(starwars)
```

1. Who is the shortest character?

2. Find all characters from  Tatooine.

#### Breakout Room Tasks

1. Who is the tallest character? (Hint: You may want to use the `desc()` function)

3. Find all droids.

4. How many droids are there? (Hint: You may want to use the `filter()` and `summarise()` functions)

5. What is the home world of Han Solo? (Hint: You may want to use the `select()` and `filter()` functions)

6. How many characters are there per species? Sort by ascending count. (Hint: You may want to use the `group_by()`, `summarise()` and `arrange()` functions)

7. Change the height from `cm` to `m`. (Hint: You may want to use the `mutate()` function)

8. Filter out all characters that have missing values (`NA`) for their mass. How many are left? (Hint: You may want to use the `select()` and `na.omit()` function)
